# Project: Simple Minesweeper

# Overview
Simple Minesweeper is a classic Minesweeper game inspired by the original Minesweeper game on Windows. The aim of this project is to create a basic version of the game that replicates the traditional Minesweeper experience with a simple, user-friendly interface. It will also include most of the features in the original game.

# Prerequisites and installation instructions
    Some fucntion might not work with lower version of python. Please use python 3/3.5 just to be sure
    I only used pygame, pygame_menu and random.
    Install by pip:
        pip install pygame -U
        pip install pygame-menu -U

    Random should come with python

# Instructions
    Run the minesweeper.py file as a script

# Future directions
    Adding user custom option for the map size and number of mines.
    Improve user interface to be more appealing.
    Maybe allow the game to work on different devices and OS.
